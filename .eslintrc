# Rule details at http://eslint.org/docs/rules/
# Specific rules usually http://eslint.org/docs/rules/<rule-name>
# First argument to a rule is always one of:
#  - 0: disable rule
#  - 1: generate warning
#  - 2: generate error
rules:

  linebreak-style:
    - 2
    - unix  # only allow LF

  # Enforced max line length. Temporarily disable in the rare cases that
  # a long line is more readable (e.g. URLs), using
  #    /* eslint-disable max-len */
  #    Your legitimately long lines here...
  #    /* eslint-enable max-len */
  max-len:
    - 2   # error to enforce compliance, disable when needed
    - 80  # line length
    - 2   # count tabs as 2 characters (required, but we don't allow tabs)


  # No logging to console, so debugging lines are not left in by mistake.
  no-console-log/no-console-log:
    - 1  # Just a warning, do not want to stop build during development

  # Do not use variables before they are defined.
  no-use-before-define:
